# Pay API - API for receivables record

## About or why of the project

The idea of this project arose from the need to issue Banco do Brasil bank slips through the API provided by the bank, but why not develop directly through the platform made available by the bank?

Because we need a microservice that serves other systems in our company and we would like to make it easier to implement on these other systems, in addition to making it easier to maintain and implement new functionality in one place.
In addition, the BB API does not generate the bank slip PDF, something that will be part of this project.
